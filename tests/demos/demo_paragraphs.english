An integer not less than 0 has a factorial.
If the integer is 0,
    the factorial is 1.
Otherwise,
    the factorial is the integer times the factorial a 2nd integer has.
        The 2nd integer is 1 less than the 1st integer.

An integer N not less than 0 has a factorial.
If N is 0,
    the factorial is 1.
Otherwise,
    the factorial is N times the factorial that an integer M has.
        M is 1 less than N.
